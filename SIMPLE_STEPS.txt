================================================================================
META APP REVIEW: SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP CHECKLIST
================================================================================

GOAL: Get your app approved by Meta so anyone can use it (no more tester accounts needed!)

================================================================================
STEP 1: WRITE PERMISSION JUSTIFICATIONS (15 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Writing 3 short explanations of why you need each permission.

WHERE: Just open a text file or Google Doc.

COPY AND PASTE THESE (they're already written for you):

---

Permission 1: instagram_basic

We use instagram_basic to retrieve the user's Instagram Business account 
information (username, account ID) immediately after they connect their 
account through OAuth. This information is displayed in the user's 
dashboard so they can identify which Instagram account is connected and 
manage their bot settings for that specific account.

---

Permission 2: instagram_manage_messages

This is the core permission for our AI chatbot service. We use 
instagram_manage_messages to:
1. Receive incoming messages from followers via Instagram webhooks
2. Send automated AI-generated replies to those followers
3. Access message history to provide context for AI responses

This permission is essential - without it, our app cannot function as 
it is the primary mechanism for message delivery and response.

---

Permission 3: pages_messaging

Instagram messaging functionality is managed through Facebook Pages. 
We require pages_messaging because:
1. Instagram Business accounts must be linked to a Facebook Page
2. The Instagram Messaging API requires this permission to send/receive messages
3. We need to access the Page's messaging capabilities to connect Instagram accounts

This is a technical requirement of the Instagram Graph API - without it, 
we cannot access messaging features even with instagram_manage_messages.

---

DONE WHEN: You have these 3 texts saved somewhere (text file, notes app, Google Doc).

================================================================================
STEP 2: CREATE TWO TEST INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS (30 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Creating TWO test accounts - one for connecting, one for messaging.

WHY TWO ACCOUNTS?
- Account A: Reviewers will connect this to your app (tests OAuth flow)
- Account B: Reviewers will message Account A (tests bot replies)
- This shows Meta the COMPLETE user experience

ACCOUNT A (For Connecting):
1. Use an existing Instagram account (or create new)
2. Make it a Business Account:
   - Settings → Account → Switch to Professional Account → Business
3. Link it to a Facebook Page (Instagram will guide you)
4. Note the Facebook account email/password (reviewers need this)

ACCOUNT B (For Messaging):
1. Create a new Instagram account (or use existing)
2. Make it a Business Account (optional, but recommended)
3. This account will send test messages to Account A

DONE WHEN: 
- Account A is Instagram Business + linked to Facebook Page
- Account B exists and can send messages
- You have credentials for both accounts written down

NOTE: Don't use your personal accounts! These will be shared with Meta reviewers.

================================================================================
STEP 3: ADD BOTH ACCOUNTS AS TESTERS (10 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Telling Meta that both test accounts can use your app.

WHERE TO DO IT:
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/
2. Click on your app (chata)
3. Go to "Roles" → "Add People"
4. Add the Facebook account linked to Account A → Make them a "Tester"
5. Add Account B's Facebook account → Make them a "Tester"
   (If Account B doesn't have Facebook, add its Instagram account)

DONE WHEN: Both accounts appear in your tester list.

================================================================================
STEP 4: TEST THE FULL FLOW YOURSELF (15 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Making sure everything works before reviewers test it.

WHERE TO DO IT:
1. Log into your app: https://getchata.com/login
2. Click "Connect Instagram"
3. Connect Account A (use Facebook login → select Instagram Account A)
4. Configure bot settings (set a personality, anything)
5. Log into Instagram Account B
6. Send a message to Account A
7. Verify Account A's bot replies automatically
8. Check your dashboard - you should see the conversation

DONE WHEN: 
- Account A is connected in your app
- Account B can message Account A
- Bot replies work correctly
- You can see conversations in dashboard

================================================================================
STEP 5: WRITE DOWN TEST CREDENTIALS (10 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Writing down login info for reviewers (both accounts).

WHERE: Open a text file or Google Doc.

COPY THIS TEMPLATE AND FILL IT IN:

================================================================================
TEST ACCOUNTS FOR META REVIEWERS
================================================================================

WHY TWO ACCOUNTS?
We provide two accounts so reviewers can test the COMPLETE user experience:
1. Account A: Reviewers connect this to our app (tests OAuth/connection flow)
2. Account B: Reviewers message Account A (tests bot messaging functionality)
This demonstrates both how users connect their accounts AND how the bot works.

================================================================================
APP LOGIN CREDENTIALS
================================================================================

URL: https://getchata.com/login
Email: [your-test-email]
Password: [secure-password]

================================================================================
ACCOUNT A - For Connecting to App
================================================================================

Facebook Account (required for Instagram connection):
- Email: [account-a-facebook-email]
- Password: [account-a-facebook-password]

Instagram Account (to connect):
- Username: @[account-a-instagram-username]
- Password: [account-a-instagram-password]
- Note: This account is linked to the Facebook Page above
- Note: This account is added as a tester in Meta Developer Console

================================================================================
ACCOUNT B - For Testing Messaging
================================================================================

Instagram Account (to send test messages):
- Username: @[account-b-instagram-username]
- Password: [account-b-instagram-password]
- Note: This account is added as a tester in Meta Developer Console

================================================================================
HOW TO TEST THE FULL FLOW
================================================================================

7. You should see Account A in your dashboard

PART 2: MESSAGING TEST (Tests bot functionality)
1. Log into Instagram Account B (use Account B credentials)
2. Send a message to Account A's Instagram account
3. The bot should automatically reply within seconds
4. Check the dashboard - you should see the conversation

PART 3: BOT SETTINGS TEST (Tests configuration)
1. In the dashboard, go to "Bot Settings"
2. Configure the bot personality/prompts
3. Send another test message from Account B
4. Verify the bot replies with the new settings

================================================================================
STRIPE TESTING (if applicable)
================================================================================

- App is in TEST MODE
- Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Any future expiry date, any CVC

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

- Both accounts are added as testers in Meta Developer Console
- Both accounts should be Instagram Business accounts
- Account A must be linked to a Facebook Page
- Webhook subscriptions activate automatically when Account A is connected
- If webhook doesn't activate, check Meta Developer Console → Webhooks

DONE WHEN: You have this complete document saved with all credentials filled in.

================================================================================
STEP 6: SWITCH STRIPE TO TEST MODE (10 minutes) - OPTIONAL
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Making sure reviewers can test payments without real money.

NOTE: If you've already done this, skip to Step 7!

WHERE TO DO IT:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Make sure you're in TEST MODE (toggle in top right)
3. Go to Render: https://dashboard.render.com
4. Go to your app → Environment
5. Update these variables:
   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY → Copy from Stripe (starts with sk_test_)
   - STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY → Copy from Stripe (starts with pk_test_)
6. Save and redeploy

DONE WHEN: 
- Stripe is in test mode
- Environment variables updated
- App redeployed
- You can test with card 4242 4242 4242 4242

================================================================================
ABOUT THE TWO VIDEOS - WHY BOTH ARE NEEDED
================================================================================

VIDEO 1 (Full Flow):
- Shows Meta reviewers HOW your app works
- Demonstrates the complete user experience
- Proves your app functions end-to-end
- Shows: signup → connect → configure → message → reply

VIDEO 2 (Permissions):
- Shows Meta reviewers WHERE each permission is used
- Maps permissions to specific features
- Explains WHY you need each permission
- Helps Meta understand your permission usage

BOTH VIDEOS WORK TOGETHER:
- Video 1 = "Here's what my app does"
- Video 2 = "Here's why I need these permissions"
- Together = Complete picture for Meta reviewers

================================================================================
STEP 7: RECORD SCREENCAST VIDEO 1 - FULL FLOW (25 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Recording a video showing the COMPLETE user experience from start to finish.

WHY THIS VIDEO MATTERS:
Meta reviewers need to see the ENTIRE flow - from signup to connecting to messaging.
This video proves your app works end-to-end.

HOW TO RECORD:
- Windows: Press Win + G → Click record button
- Or use: OBS Studio (free) or Loom (free, easy)
- Make sure your screen is clear and readable

WHAT TO RECORD (NARRATE AS YOU GO):

PART 1: SIGNUP & CONNECTION (5 minutes)
1. Start recording
2. Go to https://getchata.com
3. Show the homepage (say: "This is our homepage")
4. Click "Sign Up" or "Log In"
5. Create account or log in (say: "User creates account")
6. Show dashboard (say: "This is the user dashboard")
7. Click "Connect Instagram Account"
8. Show Facebook login popup (say: "User logs in with Facebook")
9. Show Instagram account selection (say: "User selects their Instagram account")

15. Save settings

PART 3: MESSAGING TEST (5 minutes)
16. Open Instagram Account B in another tab/window
17. Send a message to Account A (say: "Now I'm sending a test message")
18. Switch back to dashboard
19. Show the message appearing (say: "Message received via webhook")
20. Show bot generating reply (say: "Bot is generating AI reply")
21. Switch back to Instagram Account B
22. Show the bot's reply (say: "Bot automatically replied")
23. Switch back to dashboard
24. Show conversation history (say: "Conversation saved in dashboard")

PART 4: WRAP UP (1 minute)
25. Summarize what was shown (say: "This demonstrates the complete flow")
26. Stop recording

TIPS:
- Speak clearly and explain what you're doing
- Don't rush - reviewers need to see everything
- If you make a mistake, just pause and continue
- Show both the app AND Instagram to prove it works

DONE WHEN: 
- You have a 10-15 minute video showing the complete flow
- It includes signup, connection, configuration, and messaging
- Upload it to YouTube (unlisted) or Vimeo
- Copy the link (you'll need it for Step 9)

================================================================================
STEP 8: RECORD SCREENCAST VIDEO 2 - PERMISSIONS EXPLANATION (15 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Recording a focused video explaining WHERE and WHY each permission is used.

WHY THIS VIDEO MATTERS:
Meta needs to see that you're using permissions correctly. This video maps each permission
to a specific feature in your app.

HOW TO RECORD:
- Same as Video 1 (Win + G or OBS/Loom)
- Keep it shorter and more focused than Video 1

WHAT TO RECORD (NARRATE CLEARLY):

PART 1: PERMISSION 1 - instagram_basic (2 minutes)
1. Start recording
2. Show dashboard with connected Instagram account
3. Point to the account username/info
4. Say: "We use instagram_basic permission to retrieve the user's Instagram Business
   account information immediately after they connect through OAuth. This information
   is displayed here in the dashboard so users can identify which account is connected."

PART 2: PERMISSION 2 - instagram_manage_messages (4 minutes)
5. Show Bot Settings page
6. Say: "This is where users configure their bot settings"
7. Send a test message from Account B to Account A
8. Show the message appearing in dashboard/webhook logs
9. Say: "We use instagram_manage_messages to receive incoming messages from followers
   via Instagram webhooks. This is how messages come into our system."
10. Show the bot generating and sending a reply
11. Show the reply in Instagram
12. Say: "We also use instagram_manage_messages to send automated AI-generated replies
    to followers. This is the core functionality - without this permission, our app
    cannot function."

PART 3: PERMISSION 3 - pages_messaging (3 minutes)
13. Show the connection flow (or explain it)
14. Say: "Instagram messaging functionality is managed through Facebook Pages. We require
    pages_messaging because Instagram Business accounts must be linked to a Facebook Page,
    and the Instagram Messaging API requires this permission to send and receive messages.
    Without pages_messaging, we cannot access messaging features even with instagram_manage_messages."
15. Show the connected account's page association (if visible)

PART 4: SUMMARY (1 minute)
16. Summarize: "These three permissions work together: instagram_basic for account info,
    instagram_manage_messages for messaging, and pages_messaging for page-level access."
17. Stop recording

TIPS:
- Be specific - point to exactly where each permission is used
- Explain WHY you need each permission
- Keep it concise but thorough
- This video can be shorter than Video 1 (5-8 minutes is fine)

DONE WHEN: 
- You have a 5-8 minute video explaining all 3 permissions
- Each permission is clearly mapped to a feature
- Upload it to YouTube (unlisted) or Vimeo
- Copy the link (you'll need it for Step 9)

================================================================================
STEP 9: SUBMIT TO META (30 minutes)
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE DOING: Actually submitting your app for review.

WHERE TO DO IT:
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/app-review/
2. Click "Permissions and Features"
3. For EACH permission (instagram_basic, instagram_manage_messages, pages_messaging):
   - Click "Request" or "Edit"
   - Paste your justification text (from Step 1)
   - Add BOTH video links:
     * Video 1 (Full Flow) - Shows complete user experience
     * Video 2 (Permissions) - Explains where each permission is used
   - Answer any questions
4. In "Instructions for Reviewers":
   - Paste your complete test credentials document (from Step 5)
   - Include explanation of why 2 accounts are needed
5. Add Privacy Policy: https://getchata.com/privacy
6. Add Terms of Service: https://getchata.com/terms
7. Review everything one more time
8. Click "Submit for Review"

DONE WHEN: 
- All 3 permissions submitted with both videos
- Complete test credentials provided (both accounts explained)
- Privacy Policy and Terms links added
- Status shows "In Review"

================================================================================
WHAT YOU'LL HAVE AT THE END
================================================================================

1. 3 permission justifications (saved in a file)
2. Two test Instagram accounts (Account A for connecting, Account B for messaging)
3. Both accounts added as testers in Meta Developer Console
