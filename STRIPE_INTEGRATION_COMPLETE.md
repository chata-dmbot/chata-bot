## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables

Add these to your **Render environment variables** (or `.env` for local):

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXX
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXX
STRIPE_STARTER_PLAN_PRICE_ID=price_XXXXX
STRIPE_ADDON_PRICE_ID=price_XXXXX
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_XXXXX (you'll get this after setting up webhook)
```

## 🧪 Webhook Setup Recommendation

**I recommend testing locally first!**

### Option 1: Local Testing (Recommended) 🏠

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (with Chocolatey)
   choco install stripe
   
   # Mac
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   
   # Or download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
   ```

2. **Login:**
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. **Start your local app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Forward webhooks (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5000/webhook/stripe
   ```
   
   **Copy the webhook secret it gives you** (starts with `whsec_...`)

5. **Add to `.env`:**
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
   ```

6. **Test!** Make a test payment and check if webhooks are received.

### Option 2: Production Setup 🌐

1. **Deploy your code** (after testing locally)

2. **Go to Stripe Dashboard:**
   - **Developers** → **Webhooks** → **Add endpoint**

3. **Endpoint URL:**
   ```
   https://chata-bot.onrender.com/webhook/stripe
   ```

4. **Select Events:**
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.created`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_failed`

5. **Copy webhook secret** from Stripe Dashboard

6. **Add to Render environment variables**

7. **Test with a real payment!**

See `WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## 📝 What Each Route Does

### `/checkout/subscription` (POST)
- Creates Stripe Checkout session for €9/month subscription
- User is redirected to Stripe payment page

### `/checkout/addon` (POST)
- Creates Stripe Checkout session for €5 add-on purchase
- User is redirected to Stripe payment page

### `/checkout/success`
- Shows success message after payment
- Redirects to dashboard

### `/webhook/stripe` (POST)
- Receives webhook events from Stripe
- Processes subscription and payment events
- Updates database automatically
